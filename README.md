burnLVP
=======

  Python code to program using the Raspberry Pi Microchip cpu like Pic12/16F and now PIC18F....


 
     The Python code

      - burnLVP.py      Original Python code use to program pic12F... and pic16F.....
      - burn18.py       Python code to program pic18F....  
                        Currently underway! Only program code on pic18F258 at the moment.
  

     Experimental V2.0  and ongoing version (Not fully finished)

      - burnLVPx.py     Version to burn PIC12 and PIC18 Familly.
      - CpuPIC12.py	    PIC12 class
      - CpuPIC18F.py    PIC18 generic class
      - CpuPIC18FXX2    PIC18FXX2 class  (like  PIC18F258)
      - CpuPIC18F2XXX   PIC18F2XXX Class (like PIC18F2580)
      - CpuPIC18FXXK80  PIC18FXXKXX Class (like PIC18F26K80)
      - burnGPIO.py     IO interface to quickly change type  of IO. (PC , USB, etc..)
